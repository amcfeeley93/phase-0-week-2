What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to act as a professional website. It will feature my photo, my contact information, a link to my blog, an about me, and my projects.


What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience will be employers and professionals. The site will address them by featuring my work as well as a brief overview of who I am.


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action for employers coming to my site will be to see my portfolio and contact me.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design and user experience go hand and hand. The idea of user experience is to create a design that the user wants to see and how the user wants to interact. You want a good design so that it is visually appealing as well as a well planned design so that the user makes the most out of their interaction.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience designers focus on the feeling you have when using a system. User experience design is meant to appeal to the user in every way while being as efficient as possible. User experience design is valuable because
it doesnt only focus on the usability, but it focuses on the feelings it provokes.
