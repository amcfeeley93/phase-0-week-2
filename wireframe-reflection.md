What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is basically a blueprint that outlines what you want your website to look like.


What are the benefits of wireframing?
It allows the developer to test ideas and refine the navigation of the page. By creating a wireframe you can make sure the user interface design is as effective as possible.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I enjoyed wireframing my site because I was able to design something from scratch. 

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I revised my framework as I learned from examples on other websites.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
The concept of adding images by markdown still confuses me a little. Ive researched what to do, but the websites that I've found don't provide a clear explanation.


Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed designing the wireframe the best. My least favorite it setting up the markdown.
